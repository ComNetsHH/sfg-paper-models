The paper "Analytic study of packet delay from 4G and 5G system ARQs using Signal Flow Graphs" is published at the VTC2020-Spring conference in Antwerp, Belgium.

In it, Signal Flow Graph are used to model 4G and 5G communication systems.

In the `matlab/` directory you can find MATLAB code for the analytic study of the modeled systems' packet delays.

In the `simulation-model/` you can find simuLTE code for the simulations performed using the OMNeT++ simulator.
